## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, also known by my online alias "subbotted", and I'm 19 years of age and a Web/Desktop Application Developer with over five years of experience! I'm located in Hereford, United Kingdom and currently working for [Clarke Software](https://www.clarkesoftware.com). I am not interested in job opportunities at this moment in time.

### Languages & Experience
I have real-world experience in a multitude of languages with target platforms spanning from Web, Desktop to Mobile.
- Five years of experience in Java (Desktop applications in JavaFX & Swing, minecraft server plugins using the Bukkit API)
- Two years of experience in C# (.NET Core & Framework with ASP.NET for Web, WPF for Desktop & Xamarin for cross-platform mobile applications)
- Three years of experience in web-based languages including HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Three years of experience in PHP & SQL
My primary language I work with at the moment is C# as that is what we primarily use at my workplace, however I do still use Java now and again for personal projects as it is my preferred language.

### Portfolio
I do not currently have a public portfolio available as all of my contributions are towards private repositories, and my previous portfolio projects which I created years ago are not an accurate representation of my skill-set and knowledge at this moment in time, therefore I have archived them all.
