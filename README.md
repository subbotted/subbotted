### About Me

Over the years, I've worked extensively with various object-oriented programming languages and developed for platforms including web, desktop, and mobile.

I began my journey as a Java developer and transitioned into full-stack web development. Since 2020, my primary focus has been on the C# .NET ecosystem.
